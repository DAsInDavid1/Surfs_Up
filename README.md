# Surf & Ice Cream Shop Weather Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if it was sustainable for a ice cream and surf shop was a good investment based off of weather data. We looked at June and December to determine if this was a sustainable year-round business or not.

## Results
Thre results we can come to based off our summary statistics for June and December
1. As seen in this June chart below, June would be a viable month to have the shop open. It will be above 73&#176;f 75% of the time. Above 70&#176;f can be ice cream and surfing weather. This will allow us to stay open a vast majority of June

2. December will be harder to stay open but it should still be fesable to stay open year round. As seen on the summary chart below, 50% of the time it is greater then 71&#176;f which is still ice cream weather. You might need to close on sum days as the min temperature is 56&#176;f which is no where near ice cream or surfing weather.

3. June will be a much more profitable time since on average the temperature will be higher and less chance for it to get below 70&#176;f. We can assume the surrounding months during the summer to be somewhat similar so their should be little chance of us needing to be closed due to the temperature. December however, will be harder to plan around. It can get very cold and on average is on the brink of going below 70&#176;f almost 50% of the time. This doesnt mean people will not buy ice cream but it should be expected that a decrese in sales will happen during december.
